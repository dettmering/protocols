Staining of intracellular antigens for flow cytometry
=====================================================

Materials
---------

* Phosphate buffered saline, no Ca2+, no Mg2+ (PBS)
* 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS (PFA)
* 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA)
* 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (Triton)
* primary Antibody (start with 1:100 dilution)
* secondary Antibody (start with 1:300-400 dilution)
* 0.5 µg/ml DAPI in PBS (1 ml) per sample.
* Mounting medium of your choice, clear nail varnish for sealing

Protocol
--------

### Fixing cells

1. Remove medium from petri dishes
2. Wash with 0.5 ml Trypsin, discard Trypsin
3. Add 0.5 ml Trypsin, incubate 5 min @ 37°C
4. Separate cells properly with 1 ml Eppendorf pipet, don't take too much time for this step. Pool now two or more dishes together.
5. Add 3 ml medium to stop Trypsin.
6. Washing cells: centrifuge 8 min @ 300g, discard supernatant, resuspend with 95 µl pipet.
7. Add 1 ml 2% Paraformaldehyde Incubate 8 min at room temperature
8. Add 2 ml PBS and centrifuge 8 min @ 300g
9. Discard supernatant, resuspend cells with 95 µl pipet
10. Add 1 ml 0.5 % Triton X-100, incubate 5 min (critical!) at room temperature.
11. Add 2 ml PBS and centrifuge 8 min (critical!) @ 300g
12. Discard supernatant, resuspend with 95 µl pipet.
13. Add 1 ml 0.4 % BSA, incubate at least 30 min @ RT

At this point samples may be stored for up to 7 days in at 4°C.

### Primary Antibody Staining

14. Dilute primary antibody 1:100 in an end volume of 100 µl per sample
15. Centrifuge 8 min @ 300 xg, discard supernatant completely. Remove residual supernatant carefully with 200 µl pipet.
16. Resuspend pellet with 95 µl of antibody solution
17. Incubate 60 min at room temperature

### Secondary Antibody Staining

18. Add 1 ml PBS, centrifuge 8 min @ 1600 rpm, discard supernatant completely.
19. Dilute secondary antibody 1:300-400 in an end volume of 100 µl per sample
20. Resuspend pellet with 95 µl of antibody solution
21. Incubate 45 min at room temperature in the dark.
22. Add 1 ml PBS supplied with 1 µg/ml DAPI to the tubes
23. Incubate 15 min at room temperature
24. Centrifuge 8 min @ 300g
25. Discard supernatant and resuspend in 500 µl PBS
16. Analyse
