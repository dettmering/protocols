Immunofluorescence in cell cultures
===================================

(by Till Dettmering, 06 03 2014)

Materials
---------

* Phosphate buffered saline, no Ca2+, no Mg2+ (PBS)
* 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS (PFA)
* 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA)
* 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (Triton)
* primary Antibody (start with 1:100 dilution)
* secondary Antibody (start with 1:300-400 dilution)
* 0.5 µg/ml DAPI in PBS (1 ml) per sample. You may also add labeled Phalloidin to get a cytoplasmatic staining. *Caution: Phalloidin and possibly DAPI are highly cancerogenic!*
* Mounting medium of your choice, clear nail varnish for sealing

Preparation
-----------

Grow cells on cover slips in a petri dish. Perform all subsequent steps in the petri dish, remove cover slip only to mount it on a microscope slide.

Protocol
--------

1. Remove Medium
2. Wash with PBS
3. Fix cells with PFA for 15 min @ RT
4. Wash with PBS
5. Permeabilize cells with Triton for 8 min @ RT
6. Wash with PBS
7. Block with BSA for 30 min @ RT
8. Dilute primary Ab in BSA. 100 µl of solution per cover slip are usually enough.
9. Add 95 µl (to account for pipetting error) on top of each cover slip. Make sure that the cover slip does not touch the border of the petri dish. The drop will stay on the cover slip.
10. Incubate 1 h @ RT or over night @ 4°C if the staining is too weak
11. Wash 3 x 5 min with PBS on shaker
12. Dilute secondary Ab in BSA. Perform subsequent steps in the dark.
13. Incubate secondary Ab 45 min @ RT
14. Wash 2-3 x 5 min with PBS on shaker
15. Add 1 ml DAPI (+ Phalloidin) solution
16. Incubate 15 min @ RT
17. Wash 2-3 x 5 min with PBS on shaker
18. Wash with deionized water to avoid fluorescent PBS crystals
19. Carefully lift cover slips with tweezers and lean them on the petri dish wall to dry (i.e. 30 min)
20. Mount on microscope slide, seal with nail varnish
